## Acknowledgements

This wouldn't have been possible without a few people who have helped immensely.

- [emulamer](https://github.com/emulamer/): Created [BeatOn](https://github.com/emulamer/BeatOn), provided support, tested, and in general just a great person to talk to. This wouldn't exist at all if not for him motivating me to keep working.
- [jakibaki](https://github.com/jakibaki/): Created the library that actually supports all of the mod loading, as well as a lot of support when developing (and bearing with my annoying questions).
- [leo60228](https://github.com/leo60228): Created the custom colors mod using jakibaki's mod loader. The first mod that used her library.
- Trueavid#8335 (Discord): Helped test various things.
